#  DTTE Projects at IHub data


### PROJECT-1 : Genomic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in India

 - Conducted an in-depth analysis of 685 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences collected from individuals in India. Investigated the genetic diversity of the virus and its implications for the spread of COVID-19 in the country.

 - Utilized k-mer-based methods to represent genome sequences as vectors.

 - Employed PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

 - Examined mutation profiles to understand the presence or absence of specific mutations in the genomes.

 - Investigated the demographic distribution of mutations to gain insights into regional variations in the virus's genetic makeup.

### PROJECT-2 : Diabetes Prediction on Pima Indian Women dataset

 - The project aimed to uncover the factors associated with diabetes in this population and develop a predictive model based on health-related attributes.

 - Conducted exploratory data analysis(EDA), Data Preprocessing to prepare the data.

 - Performed hyperparameter tuning on KNN algorithm to find the optimal K value.


### PROJECT-3 : Perceptron and Gradient Descent

 - Implementing and playing around various parameters of Gradient Descent algorithm.
   
### PROJECT-4 : Finger Counting Using Image Processing and Machine Learning


 - Developed a machine learning-based solution for counting the number of fingers in hand images. This project leveraged image analysis techniques and by using fundamental machine learning algorithm.

 - Custom clustering algorithm to identify and group finger points in the image.

 - Trained a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the number of fingers based on the clustered finger points.

### PROJECT-5 : Regression Analysis on COVID-19 Data

 - Conducted regression analysis techniques to predict early COVID-19 cases using a dataset containing information on the spread of the virus

 - Conducted hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the Ridge Regression models

 - Evaluated model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) metrics


### PROJECT-6 : Movie Recommendation System

 - Implemented a movie recommendation system and user clustering using the K-Means algorithm

 - Tried collaborative filtering techniques to implement movie recommendation(using fast.ai).
